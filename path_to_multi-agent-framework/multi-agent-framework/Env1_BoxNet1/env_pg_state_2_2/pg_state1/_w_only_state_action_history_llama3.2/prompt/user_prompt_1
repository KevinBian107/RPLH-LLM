    You're a box-moving agent in a multi-agent system, stationed on a 1x1 square in a grid playground. You can only interact with objects in your square. Squares are denoted by their center coordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]), and actions involve moving boxes to targets or nearby squares, represented by colors (e.g., move(box_red, target_red)). Each square can contain many targets and boxes.
    All the agents coordinate with others together to come out a plan and achieve the goal: match each box with its color-coded target.
    The current state and possible actions of yourself are: {Agent[0.5, 0.5]: in square[0.5, 0.5], can observe ['box_green', 'box_purple', 'box_orange'], can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_orange, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_orange, square[0.5, 1.5])']
}.
    The current states and possible actions of all other agents are: {Agent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'box_red', 'target_red', 'box_red', 'target_green', 'target_purple', 'target_purple'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']
Agent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_blue', 'box_red', 'target_red', 'target_green', 'target_orange'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']
Agent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'target_red', 'box_green', 'box_purple'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[1.5, 0.5])']
}.

    Please learn from previous steps. Not purely repeat the actions but learn why the state changes or remains in a dead loop. Avoid being stuck in action loops.

    
    [Action Output Instruction]
    Must first output 'EXECUTE', then on the new line specify your action plan in this format: {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]":"move..."}.
    Include an agent only if it has a task next.
    Example#1: 
    EXECUTE
    {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]":"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])"}
    
    Example#2: 
    EXECUTE
    {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, target_blue)", "Agent[2.5, 1.5]":"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])"}
    
    The previous dialogue history is: {}
    Think step-by-step about the task and the previous dialogue history. Carefully check and correct them if they made a mistake.
    Respond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said. Discuss with others to come up with the best plan.
    Propose exactly one action for yourself at the **current** round.
    End your response by either: 1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion; 2) If everyone has made proposals and got approved, output the final plan, must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!
